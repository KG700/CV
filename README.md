I am an enthusiastic, positive and self-motivated person, who enjoys taking on new challenges. I actively innovate and
seek opportunities to improve work processes and operations. I also love working in teams; enjoying bouncing ideas off
co-workers and achieving joint goals.

I was first introduced to programming eight years ago in a previous job. Whilst not a requirement for the role I became
passionate about coding as it became a great outlet for my creative energies and passion for problem solving. I soon
realised I would love to do this as my career. Over the past eight years I have also developed other skills such as personal
and stakeholder management, project delivery and team-building. Now that I have permament residency in the UK (and not reliant
on employer sponsorship) I am now able to pursue a career in software development.

#Skills

#### Teamwork & Collaboration
As an Econometrician I lead a team of up to 5 colleagues that delivered projects successfully and on time.
I did this by creating a nurturing team environment where all members felt happy to contribute to team discussions and
everyone respected each others contributions. I also instilled in the team a shared goal of meeting the timing plan goals,
which we met by keeping track of everyone's progress and encouraging the team to help out when others have fallen behind.

#### Problem Solving
I've always enjoyed solving problems. One example of this is at Sky where I became known as the expert at media optimisation.
This involves using out our Econometric models results to work out how Sky could plan their media campaigns better. Sky is
the UK's biggest advertiser, so this was a huge challenge. It allowed me to be creative and write Excel-based programmes using
vba to create user-friendly and efficient methods of solving this problem.

#### Communication
I'm a strong communicator, able to easily adapt my style to suitable audiences such as colleagues, managers and stakeholders.
As an Econometrician is was important to be able to communicate technical details to a non-technical audience which I was able
to do successfully.

#Experience

**Sky Ltd** (June 2015 to December 2019)    
*Principal Econometrician (March 2017 to December 2019)  
*Lead Econometrician (June 2015 to February 2017)  
While at Sky I was responsible for managing teams of up to 5 colleagues to deliver Econometric projects on time. I also became
an expert amongst my colleagues on technical aspects of the role and I was always willing to help share this knowledge with
everyone on the team. I developed training decks to help new team members and willingly put time aside to go through my colleague's
questions.

**Ohal Ltd** *(now known as Gain Theory)* (June 2011 to May 2015)   
*Senior Analyst (*January 2014 to April 2015)
*Analyst (September 2012 to January 2014)
*Graduate Analyt (August 2011 to September 2012)
Alongside learning the art of building Econometric models to answer key client questions about their sales drivers, I was also
responsible for data collection and processing this data. Since data comes in many different formats, this develped my problem
solving ability by having to work out how to process data into a format we could use.

Ohal also gave me the opportunity to learn to code in vba, then later to dabble in JavaScript, HTML/CSS & Python. I took on this
new challenge with great enthusiasm, building macros that helped make my job easier, a browser based tool that we shared with
stakeholders, plus I also built macros at home for fun.
