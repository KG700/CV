I am an enthusiastic, positive and self-motivated person, who enjoys taking on new challenges. I enjoy developing my technical knowledge which has lead to many successes in my past. A career in software development excites me due to the endless possible areas to learn. I also love working in teams; bouncing ideas off co-workers and achieving joint goals. Over the past eight years I have also developed other skills such as personal and stakeholder management, project delivery and team-building.

I was first introduced to programming eight years ago in a previous job. Whilst not a requirement for the role I became
passionate about coding as it was a great outlet for my creative energies and passion for problem solving. I soon
realised I would love to do this as my career. Completing the Makers Academy software development bootcamp was my first step towards changing my career. I now look forward to building on what I've learnt in my quest to becoming a successful software developer.


## Skills

#### Teamwork & Collaboration
I enjoy working in teams and work hard to ensure my team is happy, engaged and collaborating with each other. As an Econometrician I lead a team of up to 5 colleagues that delivered projects successfully and on time. Being a team leader helped me to become a better team player because it was my responsibility to think about each member of the team. I made sure each person was heard and treated with respect, I knew what areas each person wanted to develop and did my best to ensure they were given appropriate opportunities. I also actively encouraged my team to help and ask for help from each other, which cultivated a collaborative and supportive environment.

#### Problem Solving
I've always enjoyed solving problems. One example of this is at Sky where I became known as the expert at media optimisation.
This involved using our Econometric models results to work out how Sky could plan their media campaigns better. Sky is
the UK's biggest advertiser, so this was a huge challenge. It allowed me to be creative and write Excel-based programmes using
VBA to create user-friendly and efficient methods of solving this problem.

#### Communication
I'm a strong communicator, able to easily adapt my style to suitable audiences such as colleagues, managers and stakeholders.
As an Econometrician it was important to be able to communicate technical details to a non-technical audiences which I was able
to do successfully. It was also important as a team leader to communicate clearly to my team to ensure everyone was working towards the same goals.

#### Time management
I am very effective at organising my time to achieve my workload in a timely manner. I think it's really important to have a clear idea of what needs to be achieved at the different stages of a project. As a team leader, I instilled in my team a shared goal of meeting the timing plan goals,
which we met by keeping track of everyone's progress and encouraging the team to help out when others had fallen behind.

## Experience

**Sky Ltd** (June 2015 to December 2019)    
*Principal Econometrician (March 2017 to December 2019)  
*Lead Econometrician (June 2015 to February 2017)  
While at Sky I was responsible for managing teams of up to 5 colleagues to deliver Econometric projects on time. I also became
an expert amongst my colleagues on technical aspects of the role and I was always willing to help share this knowledge with
everyone on the team. I developed training decks to help new team members and willingly put time aside to go through my colleague's
questions.

**Ohal Ltd** *(now known as Gain Theory)* (June 2011 to May 2015)   
*Senior Analyst (*January 2014 to April 2015)
*Analyst (September 2012 to January 2014)
*Graduate Analyt (August 2011 to September 2012)
Alongside learning the art of building Econometric models to answer key client questions about their sales drivers, I was also
responsible for data collection and processing this data. Since data comes in many different formats, this develped my problem
solving ability by having to work out how to process data into a format we could use.

Ohal also gave me the opportunity to learn to code in vba, then later to dabble in JavaScript, HTML/CSS & Python. I took on this
new challenge with great enthusiasm, building macros that helped make my job easier, a browser based tool that we shared with
stakeholders, plus I also built macros at home for fun.
