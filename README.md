## Karla Gardiner

I am an enthusiastic, positive and self-motivated person, who enjoys taking on challenges. I have developed excellent 
organisational and communication skills during my career to date. I actively innovate and improve and seek opportunities
to demonstrate this. I also love working in teams. Being introduced to programming 6 years ago not only opened up a 
passion for coding as a new and creative outlet for problem solving, it was also when I realised I would love to do this 
as my career. It has taken 6 years or so, but I have now, finally, taken steps required to become a software developer. 
I am really excited to start my new career.

## Skills

#### Teamwork & Collaboration
It was essential to work effectively in teams as an Econometrician in order to build good quality models that make sense. 

#### Problem Solving

#### Communication
My communication skills have developed in many different ways during my career as an Econometrician. As well as communicating
well in teams, I was required to communicate our results to stakeholders who were often not technically minded...

## Experience

**Sky Ltd** (June 2015 to December)    
*Principal Econometrician*  

I became known as the expert at media optimisation at Sky. This involves using diminishing returns curves that represent
the performance of Sky's different media channels across campaigns, as measured by our Econometric models, to solve how
Sky should plan their media campaigns better. Sky is the UK's biggest advertiser, so this was a huge challenge. It allowed 
me to be creative and write Excel-based programmes using vba to create user-friendly and efficient methods of solving this 
problem.

At Sky I always believed that the best Econometric models are created by teams rather than individuals, and I always
advocated this. I always encourage the team to respect each other, communicate, collaborate and have fun.

Mention management and leadership?

**Ohal Ltd** *(now known as Gain Theory)* (June 2011 to May 2015)   
*Senior Econometrician*  
Alongside learning the art of building Econometric models to answer key client questions about their sales drivers, Ohal gave
me the opportunity to learn to code in vba, then later to dabble in JavaScript, HTML/CSS & Python. I took on this new challenge
with great enthusiasm, building macros that helped make my job easier, as well as buidling fun macros at home. As I improved 
I started focusing on writing my code neatly and efficiently.

## Hobbies

- Reading
- Watching Netflix
- Trying to learn new things (e.g. knitting, Spanish, German, anything really)
